# donation-site

This is my first assignment to prove my worth by converting a PSD to HTML and CSS. 

I've tried my best to develop the webpage in a very shorter period of time as a beginner.

***********
I've added a new section {{Our pleasure of Journey}} based of my research of different site availavail on internet which may improve the outlook of a donation site. Previous activities may encourage the people to stand by humanity.
